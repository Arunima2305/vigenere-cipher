# Vigenère Cipher: Encryption and Decryption Web Application

## Overview

This project is a web application that implements the Vigenère Cipher for encryption and decryption of text. It provides users with the ability to encrypt and decrypt text using either a password or a substitution dictionary, and includes a feature for cryptanalysis to recover the original password from encrypted text.

## Features

- **Encryption and Decryption**: Allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using the Vigenère Cipher, either with a password or a custom substitution dictionary.
- **Cryptanalysis**: Provides a feature to analyze encrypted text and recover the original password, demonstrating advanced cryptanalysis techniques.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with React to create an intuitive and responsive user interface.
- **Python (Flask) Backend**: Handles encryption, decryption, and cryptanalysis on the server side, ensuring efficient processing.
- **Original Code**: Original code is also provided for encryption, decryption, and cryptanalysi.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python (Flask)**: Used to build the backend API for encryption, decryption, and cryptanalysis.
- **React**: Powers the frontend, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **JavaScript**: Facilitates client-side logic and interactions with the backend API.
- **CSS**: Styles the application, ensuring a visually appealing user experience.

## Usage
- **Encrypt Text**: Enter the text and a password or a substitution dictionary, then click "Encrypt" to generate the encrypted text using the Vigenère Cipher.
- **Decrypt Text**: Input the encrypted text and the corresponding password or substitution dictionary, then click "Decrypt" to retrieve the original plaintext-.
- **Find Password:** Analyze encrypted text to recover the original password using built-in cryptanalysis techniques, demonstrating the vulnerability of certain encryption methods.
